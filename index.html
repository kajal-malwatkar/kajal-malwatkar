        <h2>Biodiversity</h2>

            Biodiversity and wildlife abundance: The argument to save the world's wildlife 
            has often come from an aesthetic point of view. Many conservationists have
             fought to save species simply because they like a particular species. This is 
             often why more popularly known animals—tigers, elephants, rhinos—receive far
              more attention than less popular (although just as endangered) wildlife—for 
              example, the redbelly egg frog, the smokey bat, or the bastard quiver tree.

               But beyond making the world a less lonely, less boring, and less beautiful 
               place—admirable reasons in themselves—many of the services provided by 
               biodiversity are similar to those provided by all of nature. Biodiversity 
               produces food, fibers, wood products; it cleans water, controls agricultural 
               pests, pollinates and dispersers the world plants; and provides recreation, 
               such as birdwatching, gardening, diving, and ecotourism.

                Nature is defined as our environment. 
                It is the interaction between the 
                physical world around us and the life within it like the atmosphere, 
                climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna and humans. Nature 
                also includes non-living things such as water, mountains, landscape, 
                plants, trees and many other things.
